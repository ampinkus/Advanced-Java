 /* Singleton pattern:
    Singleton is a creational design pattern, which ensures that only one object of its kind exists and provides
    a single point of access to it for any other code.  It is nothing but a way of defining a class.
    Class is defined in such a way that only one instance of the class is created in the complete execution of a program or project.
    It is used where only a single instance of a class is required to control the action throughout the execution. A singleton class shouldnâ€™t have
    multiple instances in any case and at any cost. Singleton classes are used for logging, driver objects, caching and thread pool, database connections.
    This pattern involves a single class which is responsible to create an object while making sure that only single object gets created.
    This class provides a way to access its only object, which can be accessed directly without need to instantiate the object of the class.
    The most popular approach is to implement a Singleton by creating a regular class and making sure it has:
        * A private constructor
        * A static field containing its only instance
        * A static factory method for obtaining the instance
